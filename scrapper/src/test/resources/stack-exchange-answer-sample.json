This includes both XML (<a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-xml</a>) and CSV (<a href=\"https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-csv/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson-dataformat-csv/</a>) backends.</p>\n\n<p>Conversion would rely on reading input with CSV backend, write using XML backend. This is easiest to do if you have (or can define) a POJO for per-row (CSV) entries. This is not a strict requirement, as content from CSV may be read \"untyped\" as well (a sequence of <code>String</code> arrays), but requires bit more work on XML output.</p>\n\n<p>For XML side, you would need a wrapper root object to contain array or <code>List</code> of objects to serialize.</p>\n"
